Just some dockerfiles for various Atlassian software.

* **base** - core image all others are built upon; presently based on Debian jessie
* **crowd** - one authenticator to rule them all
* **jira-software** - issue tracking gone agile
* **confluence** - wordpress meets mediawiki
* **bitbucket** - buckets of bits, code, and whatever else your SCM needs
* **fisheye** - that thing nobody uses to search their codbase
* **crucible** - pretend to review code before a bug is found in production
* **bamboo** - build, test, deploy
